# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built as a study project to refresh my skills as I return to studying. The app allows users to add tasks to a to-do list and remove them when completed. It is built using React and React Router for routing.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Remove tasks from the list when they're completed.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Built using React for the front-end and React Router for routing.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing in React applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Pedyz/to-do-list.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd <project-directory>

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npm start

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How it Works

The app allows users to manage a to-do list by:

- Adding tasks with an input.
- Removing tasks from the list by clicking a delete button next to each item.

## Future Improvements

- Add functionality to edit tasks.
- Improve styling for a more user-friendly interface.
- Add responsive design.
